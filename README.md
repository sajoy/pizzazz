Pizzazz
---
just your everyday pizza shop that specializes in extra large, and extra small pizzas. We also make any of our pizzas into delicious pizza sticks.

To order a Pizzazz pizza, simply:
---
  1. clone this repo
  2. open index.html in your favorite browser
  3. don't gawk at cheese-less pizza 'til you've tried it!

Known Bugs:
---
* currently only offer toppings of cheese and pepperoni.
* actual pizza will not be delivered.
* not a bug: scrolling for large orders = annoying. To be remedied, eventually.
